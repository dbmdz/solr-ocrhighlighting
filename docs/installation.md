## Requirements
- Some familiarity with configuring Solr
- Solr >= 7.x
- OCR documents need to be in [hOCR](formats.md#hocr), [ALTO](formats.md#alto)
  or [MiniOCR](formats.md#miniocr) formats, with at least page-, and word-level
  segmentation

## Obtaining the plugin JAR

To use the latest release version, refer to the [GitHub Releases list](https://github.com/dbmdz/solr-ocrhighlighting/releases). From there, download the JAR file for the latest version.
To make the plugin available to Solr, create a new directory `$SOLR_HOME/contrib/ocrsearch/lib` and place the JAR you just downloaded there.


# Core Configuration

To enable the use of the plugin for your Solr core, you will have to edit
both the `solrconfig.xml` and the `schema.xml` file in your core's `conf` directory.

## SolrConfig

In your core's `solrconfig.xml, you need to:

1. Instruct the core to load the OCR highlighting plugin so it can find the classes
   needed to perform OCR indexing and highlighting.
2. Define a search component that will perform the OCR highlighting at query time
3. Add the search component to your request handlers that will trigger the highlighting.


```xml
<config>
  <!-- ...other configuration options... -->

  <!--
    Tell Solr to load all JAR files from the directory installed the plugin to. 
    This assumes a directory structure where the cores are in `$SOLR_HOME/server/solr/$CORE`
    and the plugin JAR was installed in `$SOLR_HOME/contrib/ocrsearch/lib`. Adjust the
    path if you setup differs.
  -->
  <lib dir="../../../contrib/ocrsearch/lib" regex=".*\.jar" />

  <!-- Add a new named search component that takes care of highlighting OCR field values. -->
  <searchComponent class="de.digitalcollections.solrocr.solr.OcrHighlightComponent"
                   name="ocrHighlight" />

   <!-- ...other search components... -->

  <!--
    Instruct the request handlers you want to enable OCR highlighting for to include the
    search component you defined above. This example uses the standard /select handler.

    CAUTION: Make sure that the OCR highlight component is listed **before** the standard
    highlighting component, i.e. explicitely like in this example or with `first-components`
  -->
  <requestHandler name="/select" class="solr.SearchHandler">
      <arr name="components">
          <str>query</str>
          <str>ocrHighlight</str>
          <str>highlight</str>
      </arr>
  </requestHandler>
</config>
```

If you run into problems, a look into these sections of the Solr user's guide might be helpful:

- [Resource and Plugin Loading](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_1/resource-and-plugin-loading.html)
- [RequestHandlers and SearchComponents in SolrConfig](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_1/requesthandlers-and-searchcomponents-in-solrconfig.html)


## Schema 

In the core's `schema.xml`, you need to:

1. Define a new field type that will hold your indexed OCR text
2. Define which fields are going to hold the indexed OCR text.

The **field type** for OCR text is usually identical to your regular text field, with the
difference that there are two extra *character filters* at the beginning of your *index analysis chain*:
  - `ExternalUtf8ContentFilterFactory` will allow you to index and highlight OCR from external
    sources on the file system. More on this in the [Indexing chapter](./indexing.md).
  - `OcrCharFilterFactory` will retrieve the raw OCR data and extract the plain text that is
    going to pass through the rest of the analysis chain. It will auto-detect the used OCR
    formats, which means that **you can use different OCR formats alongside each other**.
    After this filter, Solr will treat the field just like a regular text field for purposes
    of analysis.

```xml
<schema>
  <types>
    <fieldtype name="text_ocr" class="solr.TextField" storeOffsetsWithPositions="true" 
               termVectors="true">
      <analyzer type="index">
        <!-- For loading external files as field values during indexing -->
        <charFilter class="de.digitalcollections.solrocr.lucene.filters.ExternalUtf8ContentFilterFactory" />
        <!-- For converting OCR to plaintext -->
        <charFilter class="de.digitalcollections.solrocr.lucene.filters.OcrCharFilterFactory" />
        <!-- ...rest of your index analysis chain... -->
      </analyzer>
      <analyzer type="query">
        <!-- your query analysis chain, should not include the character filters -->
      </analyzer>
    </fieldtype>
  </types>

  <fields>
    <!-- ...your other fields ... -->

    <!-- A field that uses the OCR field type. Has to be `stored`. -->
    <field name="ocr_text" type="text_ocr" multiValued="false" indexed="true" stored="true" />
  </fields>
</schema>
```

If you struggle with setting up your schema, a look into the [Schema Design](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_1/documents-fields-and-schema-design.html)
chapter of the Solr user's guide might be helpful.
