In general the plugin assumes that all OCR formats encode their documents
in a hierarchy of **blocks**. For all supported formats, we map their
corresponding block types to these general types (blocks in italics are
entirely optional):

- **Page**: optional if there is only a single page in a document)
- **Block**: optional if `hl.ocr.limitBlock` is set to a different value at
  query time
- **Section**: optional
- **Paragraph**: optional
- **Line**: (optional if `hl.ocr.contextBlock` is set to a different value
  at query time)
- **Word**: *required*

These block types can be used in the `hl.ocr.limitBlock` and `hl.ocr.contextBlock`
[query parameters](queryparams.md) to control the formation of snippets.

## hOCR

In the **Solr configuration**, set the `ocrFormat` attribute on the `<searchComponent />` to
`org.mdz.search.solrocr.formats.hocr.HocrFormat`.

In the **Schema**, make sure that `solr.HTMLStripCharFilterFactory` is the first filter
in your indexing analyzer chain for OCR fields.

**Block type mapping:**

| Block     | hOCR class                  | notes                            |
| --------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Word      | `ocrx_word`                 | needs to have a `bbox` attribute with the coordinates on the page |
| Page      | `ocr_page`                  | needs to have a `ppageno` attribute with a page identifier |
| Block     | `ocr_carea`/`ocrx_block`    |                                  |
| Section   | `ocr_chapter`/`ocr_section`/<br>`ocr_subsection`/`ocr_subsubsection` | |
| Paragraph | `ocr_par`                   |                                  |
| Line      | `ocr_line` or `ocrx_line`   |                                  |

## ALTO

In the **Solr configuration**, set the `ocrFormat` attribute on the `<searchComponent />` to
`org.mdz.search.solrocr.formats.alto.AltoFormat`.

In the **Schema**, make sure that `org.mdz.search.solrocr.formats.alto.AltoCharFilterFactory`
and `solr.HTMLStripCharFilterFactory` are the first two filters in your indexing analyzer
chain for OCR fields.

**Block type mapping:**

| Block     | ALTO tag                    | notes                            |
| --------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Word      | `<String />`                | needs to have `CONTENT`, `HPOS`, `VPOS`, `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` attributes |
| Line      | `<TextLine />`              |                                  |
| Block     | `<TextBlock />`             |                                  |
| Page      | `<Page />`                  | needs to have an `ID` attribute with a page identifier |
| Section   | *not mapped*                |                                  |
| Paragraph | *not mapped*                |                                  |


## MiniOCR

This plugin also includes support for a custom non-standard OCR format that
we dubbed *MiniOCR*. This format is intended for use cases where reusing the
existing OCR files is not possible (e.g. because they're in an unsupported
format or because you don't want to ASCII-encode them and still use the
modern highlighting approach). In these cases, minimizing the storage
requirements for the derived OCR files is important, which is why we defined
this minimalistic format.

A basic example looks like this:

```xml
<p id="page_identifier">
  <b>
    <l><w x="50 50 100 100">A</w> <w x="150 50 100 100">Line</w></l>
  </b>
</p>
```

**Block type mapping:**

| Block     | MiniOCR tag  | notes                            |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Word      | `<w/>`       | needs to have `box` attribute with `{x} {y} {width} {height}`. <br>Values can be integers or floats between 0 and 1 |
| Line      | `<l/>`       |                                  |
| Block     | `<b/>`       |                                  |
| Page      | `<p/>`       | needs to have an `id` attribute with a page identifier |
| Section   | *not mapped* |                                  |
| Paragraph | *not mapped* |                                  |
